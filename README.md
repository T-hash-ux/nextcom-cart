Project Title:
Project Xcel 

Project Description:
Project Xcel is a project management software that allows companies to manage their projects with ease. Future development 
plans for the application to be used by both clients and project management team. This application is user friendly and 
allows us to store client and project information. You can store the client's name email and phone number to help you keep 
in contact with them and provide project updates. 

We want to make project management simple for teams and allow them to have visibiility over the entire team's project. 


Usage:
you can use this application from our deployed link or you can start the application from the terminal. 


Challenges: 
Merging conflicts can occur, a round robin approach would be preffered in future collaboration or a stronger foundation in
how all parts connect. This is something we can increase our knowledge on.
